# Keylogger

This project implements a simple keylogger in Python. It captures and logs keystrokes to a text file for monitoring purposes. The keylogger uses the `pynput` library to listen for keyboard events, including alphanumeric keys and special keys.

## Features

- Logs all keystrokes to a file (`keylog.txt`).
- Captures both normal and special keys.
- Exits gracefully when the `Esc` key is pressed.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `pynput` library

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/b17w1z4rd/Keylogger.git
   cd Keylogger
2. Install the required library:
   **pip install pynput**
3. Run the script:
   **python keylogger.py**
